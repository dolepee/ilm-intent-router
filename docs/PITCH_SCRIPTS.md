# ILM Pitch Scripts

## 30-second pitch
ILM is an intent liquidity market for Base traders. Instead of manually routing swaps, users declare what they want and their risk constraints—max slippage, max gas, deadline. Solver agents compete to execute the intent, and the best valid route wins. We combine better execution UX with hard guardrails and onchain proof of settlement.

## 2-minute demo talk track
1. Problem: DeFi users overpay via bad routing, high slippage, and timing mistakes.
2. Product: Intent Guard lets users specify outcome + constraints, not route details.
3. Mechanism: Multiple solvers compete; invalid quotes are filtered; best valid quote wins.
4. Enforcement: Constraints are first-class checks, not UI-only suggestions.
5. Settlement: Intent lifecycle and proof hash are written onchain.
6. Business model: small fill fee + solver participation economics + premium risk modes.
7. Why now: Agent-native execution + composable onchain markets.
